> Evaluation tool for L&D Architects  
> _A semantic maze to explore, test, and reflect on strategic learning competencies._

## 🧭 Overview

**mazeproof** is a semantic evaluation framework designed for L&D professionals seeking to map, diagnose, and refine their strategic competencies.

Built as a sequence of prompts and reflections, this prototype enables AI-driven testing of adult learning architectures, revealing misalignments, thought patterns, and depth of strategic thinking.

---

## 🧪 Purpose

- Help L&D practitioners explore their own learning architecture  
- Enable self-diagnostic mapping through realistic strategic cases  
- Use AI interaction to mirror and challenge thought structures  
- Serve as an open-source artifact for ethical experimentation in EdTech
